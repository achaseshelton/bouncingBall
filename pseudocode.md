# **Bouncing Ball**

## Functionality

*Create a webpage populated with a variety of bouncing balls that change colors when they collide*

### Objects
- Array of Bouncing Balls

### Functions
- A function that defines the balls by their x and y axis, velocity on each axis, their size, and color.
- Draw function to draw the balls on the screen.
- A function that updates the balls location on the screen and keeps them within the boundaries of the screen.
- A collision function that changes the color of the balls when they collide.
- A loop function to keep the balls continually moving on the screen.

//Begin Program

function Balls() {}

balls = array

function draw.Balls() {}

function update.Balls() {
   - if balls are outside the x axis, make them move in the opposite direction
   - if the balls are outside the y axis, make them move in the opposite direction
}

function collision.Balls () {}

function loop.Balls () {}

# **Evil Ball**

## Functionality

*Create an evil ball that eats the other balls when it collides*

### Objects

- Fucntion that updates the location of the ball.
- Collision function that removes color balls when colliding with the evil ball.
- Function that allows a user to control the evil ball.

## Pseudocode

function evilBall () {
  - x axis
  - y axis
  - x velocity
  - y velocity
  - size
  - color
